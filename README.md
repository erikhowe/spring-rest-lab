## Introduction


## HAL (Hypertext Application Language)
Hal is a hypermedia format used to represent resources and to connect them in a usable way by (1) embedding related resources and (2) listing related links to other resources. Each HAL representation includes a map containing a list of links to navigate from the resource and an optional map of embedded resources to find the entire resource via its `self` link. 

## REST
REST is a collection of architectural constraints that make an application more resilient. Resilient in this context means that clients consuming the API will not experience downtime while the developers make changes to API.

First rule of REST is to never talk about...is to never delete a column, even if it means repeating information
